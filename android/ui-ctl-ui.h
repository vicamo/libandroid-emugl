 * Contains UI-side of UI control protocols. For the simplicity of implementation
 * there are two UI control services: "ui-core-control" that handle UI controls
 * initiated in the UI, and "core-ui-control" that handle UI controls initiated
 * in the core. The reason for hawing two services is that some of the UI
 * controls expect the core to respond with some data. The simplest way to
 * differentiate core commands from core responses to the UI commands, is to have
 * two separate services: one sends commands only, and another sends only
 * responses.
